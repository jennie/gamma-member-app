    <h1>About us</h1>
    We understand that finances may be strained. As a nonprofit community space,
    Gamma relies 100% on member dues to cover our expenses. However, we don’t
    want any member to feel hardship during this time, and your contributions as
    a member have value beyond dues! If you need to pause your membership, you
    can switch to the Free Community Member plan to stop your billing
    immediately while keeping your membership active. You’ll still have access
    to all of our community resources – it’s important that we remain together
    through this! If circumstances allow you to continue contributing
    financially, your support is greatly appreciated. We want there to be a
    Gamma Space to come back to and your contributions will greatly help with
    that.
